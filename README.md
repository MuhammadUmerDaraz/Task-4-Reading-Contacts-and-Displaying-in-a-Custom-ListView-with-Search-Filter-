Contacts App

Features
Contact Access & Display: Requests permission to access contacts and loads them into the app if permission is granted.
Real-Time Search Filter: Provides a search bar to filter contacts by name in real-time.
Custom ListView Design: Each contact entry is displayed with a circular avatar, name, and phone number, styled for readability.
User-Friendly UI: A consistent teal color scheme and modern design enhance the overall user experience.

Running the App
